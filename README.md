# conflict-resolution
A class example of solving a merge conflict in GitHub

## This is a change created locally

## This is a change created remotely (except, opps, this change was created locally and the change I created on GitHub that currently says it was created locally was actually created remotely :p )

### Interesting Sample

I ended up using VS code to merge these two files. I did not necessarily resolve the merge conflict, or rather I did because I told it to keep both. Next time, I will look closer and choose one to keep and one to delete.
